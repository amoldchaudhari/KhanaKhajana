Why Git-Based?
Traditional recipe-sharing platforms lack transparency, easy collaboration, and version control. By leveraging the capabilities of Git and GitHub, this repository aims to fill that gap by offering:

Transparency through complete change tracking.
Easy collaboration with features like forks, branches, and pull requests.
Robust version control to maintain the quality and integrity of each recipe.
How to Contribute
Contribution to this project follows a streamlined process designed for both novice and experienced Git users. For a complete guide on how to contribute, refer to our Contributor's Guidelines. Below is a quick summary:

Fork the Repository: Fork the main repository to your GitHub account.
Clone the Repository: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
Create a New Branch: Name it meaningfully based on what you're contributing (e.g., recipe/aloo-paratha).
Add Your Recipe: Write your recipe in a Markdown file within the appropriate cuisine folder in the recipes/ directory.
Open a Pull Request: After committing your changes, submit a pull request for review.
Implementation Steps
